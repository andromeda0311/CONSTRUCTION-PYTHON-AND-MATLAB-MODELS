Based on the analysis of visualization_insights.txt, the recommendation is to retrain the architectural cost prediction model.

Assumption:
The residual plot (residual_plot_architectural.png) shows a discernible pattern, indicating that the model is making systematic errors and has not fully captured the underlying data structure.

Reasoning:
Patterns in the residual plot point to potential issues such as non-linearity or heteroscedasticity, which compromise the model's reliability.

Recommendation for Retraining:
1.  Feature Engineering: Introduce new or transformed features to better capture non-linear relationships.
2.  Model Selection: Experiment with more complex, non-linear models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) that may be better suited for the data.
3.  Data Transformation: Apply transformations (e.g., log transform) to the target variable or features to stabilize variance.

This approach aims to develop a more robust model that produces random residuals, signifying improved predictive performance.
