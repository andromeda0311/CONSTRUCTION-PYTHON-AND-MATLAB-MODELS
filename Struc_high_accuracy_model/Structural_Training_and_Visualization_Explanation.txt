STRUCTURAL BUDGET PREDICTION: TRAINING AND VISUALIZATION EXPLANATION
================================================================================
Date: October 12, 2025
Model: LightGBM Regressor (tree-based gradient boosting)
Scope: Predict project Budget using structural features only

Selected structural features used:
- Area of formworks (sq.m.)
- Grade 40 (steel quantity/cost proxy)
- Grade 60 (steel quantity/cost proxy)
- Gross floor area (Cement floor finish)
- Total_Volume_of_Structural_Concrete (aggregated)

Files produced by the workflow:
- Structural_Total_Cost.csv: merged and computed totals from quantity × unit cost
- structural_cleaned.csv: cleaned and feature-selected dataset for modeling
- models/struc_budget_model.joblib: trained model
- visualizations/: all figures discussed below

================================================================================
1) DATA PREPARATION AND TRAINING SUMMARY
================================================================================
1. Data ingestion and merge
   - Structural quantity and unit cost CSVs are read.
   - Columns beyond the 'Structural aspect' marker are parsed as numeric.
   - Element-wise multiplication (quantity × unit cost) computes total costs.
   - Project names are standardized; Year and Budget are parsed from Year_Budget.

2. Cleaning and feature selection
   - Unnamed columns removed; numeric coercion applied; invalid rows dropped.
   - Concrete volumes consolidated into Total_Volume_of_Structural_Concrete.
   - Final features selected as listed above; duplicates and all-zero rows removed.

3. Train/test split and model
   - 80/20 split with random_state=42 for reproducibility.
   - LightGBM parameters: n_estimators≈1000 with early stopping (patience 100),
     objective=regression, eval_metric=l1 for monitoring.
   - The model monitors both training and validation sets during fit.

4. Evaluation and persistence
   - Metrics: R² on train and test; MSE on test.
   - Model persisted to models/struc_budget_model.joblib.

Honest expectation setting
- Construction costs are noisy and skewed; R² in the 0.75–0.95 range is realistic
  depending on dataset size, quality, and project diversity.

================================================================================
2) VISUALIZATIONS AND HONEST INTERPRETATIONS
================================================================================
The notebook generates five visualization types. Each serves a distinct purpose.

A) Per-feature Histogram + KDE and Boxplot
   Files: visualizations/<Feature>_visualization.png (for each selected feature)

   What you see
   - Left panel: Histogram with a KDE curve showing distribution shape.
   - Right panel: Boxplot highlighting median, IQR, and outliers.

   Typical patterns in structural data
   - Right-skewed distributions: Many projects have moderate quantities/costs, with
     fewer very large projects forming a long right tail.
   - Multiple modes: May indicate different project classes (e.g., low-rise vs mid/high-rise).
   - Numerous outliers: Reflect genuine variability (project scale, design choices),
     not necessarily data errors.

   Honest interpretation
   - Outliers are expected in construction; do not remove them blindly.
   - Strong right skew suggests considering log-transforms for targets if heteroscedasticity
     later appears in residuals (especially for Budget).
   - If a feature shows an almost degenerate distribution (most values near zero),
     reassess its predictive value or data collection consistency.

   Feature-specific notes
   - Area of formworks (sq.m.): Often aligns with building size; expect strong right skew.
   - Total_Volume_of_Structural_Concrete: Tracks with massing; high leverage on Budget.
   - Grade 40 / Grade 60: Steel-related features may show clustering by structural system.
   - Gross floor area (Cement floor finish): A general size proxy; often correlates well
     with Budget but may overlap in information with the concrete volume feature.

B) Correlation Matrix Heatmap
   File: visualizations/structural_correlation_matrix.png

   What you see
   - Heatmap of Pearson correlations among features and Budget (if included in the data shown).
   - Warm colors (red) = positive correlation; cool (blue) = negative; near-zero = weak/no linear correlation.

   Honest interpretation
   - Expect positive correlations between size/quantity features and Budget.
   - High inter-feature correlations (e.g., GFA vs. concrete volume) indicate redundancy.
     This is not harmful for tree models, but it can reduce interpretability.
   - Unexpected negative correlations or very low correlations to Budget warrant checking
     data definitions and units.

   Actionable insights
   - If two features are near duplicates, keeping both is fine for LightGBM but consider
     simplifying inputs for downstream usage or reporting.

C) Training Loss vs. Validation Loss Across Epochs
   File: visualizations/epoch_history.png

   What you see
   - Two curves (Training l1 and Validation l1) over boosting rounds.

   Desired pattern
   - Both curves decrease and then flatten; the validation curve stays close to training.

   Overfitting signs
   - Training loss keeps dropping while validation loss bottoms out then rises.
   - Large persistent gap between training and validation losses.

   Honest interpretation
   - A small, stable gap is acceptable. If the gap grows, enable stronger regularization
     (lower feature_fraction/bagging_fraction, increase min_data_in_leaf) or use
     more aggressive early stopping.
   - If both losses plateau high, the model is underfitting; try more estimators,
     adjusted depth/leaf parameters, or add informative features.

D) Actual vs Predicted – Training Set
   File: visualizations/structural_training_actual_vs_predicted.png

   What you see
   - Scatter of predicted vs actual Budget with a y=x reference line.

   Honest interpretation
   - Points close to the diagonal indicate good fit; tight clustering is expected on
     training data. Excessive tightness with poor test fit later signals overfitting.
   - Larger spread at high budgets is common (natural variance grows with project size).
   - Systematic curvature away from the diagonal suggests model bias; consider feature
     engineering (e.g., interaction or log target).

E) Actual vs Predicted – Testing Set
   File: visualizations/structural_testing_actual_vs_predicted.png

   What you see
   - Same as training, but for unseen data. This is the primary generalization check.

   Honest interpretation
   - Similar pattern to training with slightly more spread = healthy generalization.
   - Markedly worse clustering vs training (and much lower R²) = overfitting.
   - Fan-out shape (error increasing with Budget) suggests heteroscedasticity; consider
     a log(Budget) target or segmented models by project size class.

================================================================================
3) METRICS AND HOW TO READ THEM
================================================================================
- R² (train/test): Proportion of Budget variance explained. Compare train vs test:
  small gap (≤5–10%) implies good generalization; large gap (>20%) implies overfitting.
- MSE (test): Squared error in Budget units. Use RMSE (sqrt MSE) to interpret in
  the same units as currency; compare to typical project scale.

Honest guidance
- Even with a strong R², keep contingencies in real budgets due to market volatility,
  scope variability, and factors outside structural scope (site conditions, logistics).

================================================================================
4) LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
Limitations
- Model is trained on structural features only; other disciplines and soft costs are
  excluded and can drive variance.
- Historical prices and scope definitions may shift over time.
- Limited samples or narrow project mix reduce transferability to novel projects.

Recommendations
- Periodically retrain with recent projects to track market changes.
- Add complementary features (site, height, region, timeline) when available.
- Consider log-transforming Budget if test scatter shows fan-out.
- Review extreme outliers in the testing scatter; validate inputs and scope.
- Use predictions as decision support, not as sole basis for contracting.

================================================================================
5) PRACTICAL TAKEAWAYS
================================================================================
- Distribution plots explain why outliers and skew are normal in structural data.
- Correlation heatmap highlights main cost drivers and redundancies.
- Epoch history validates learning dynamics and flags over/underfitting early.
- Actual vs predicted plots provide the clearest picture of real-world performance.
- Favor test-set behavior over training-set perfection when judging usefulness.
